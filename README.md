# ML-Based-Car-Insurance-Claim-Prediction-Using-XGBoost-Gradient-Boosting
Project Description:
This project focuses on building a robust machine learning pipeline to predict whether a car insurance customer is likely to file a claim, using gradient-boosted decision trees via XGBoost. The goal is to assist insurance providers in identifying high-risk customers, enabling smarter policy decisions, reduced fraudulent claims, and optimized customer engagement.

The solution incorporates end-to-end steps from data preprocessing to model deployment, including:

 Data cleaning & preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numeric data.

 Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Understanding patterns in customer behavior and risk profiles.

 Feature engineering: Creating and selecting features that impact claim likelihood.

 Modeling with XGBoost: Gradient boosting classifier with Stratified K-Fold cross-validation for reliable performance estimates.

 Evaluation: AUC-ROC, confusion matrix, classification report, and SHAP explainability to interpret feature impact.

 Experiment tracking with MLflow: Logging parameters, metrics, and trained models for reproducibility and comparison.

This project demonstrates both predictive performance and explainability, bridging the gap between machine learning and real-world business impact.
